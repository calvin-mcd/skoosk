# skoosk

some kind of ortholinear split keyboard

The skoosk was my first attempt at creating a split ortholinear keyboard from scratch. The first production run had some issues with the pcb and the plate files. In the process of rectifying these issues I ended up creating two different PCB version, and two different types of switch and backplates.

## Project Files

*skoosk pcb rgb* contains smt assembly parts. 1 reset button and 3 rgb lights with resistors.

*skoosk pcb simple* omits these to offer a pcb file that is cheap to order and produce.

*skoosk switchplate & backplate 4 screwholes* each have 4 outer screwholes that give the sandwhich assembly a good amount of bounce.

*skoosk switchplate & backplate 8 screwholes* have 8 screwholes in total to offer more stability for the whole sandwhich case.
