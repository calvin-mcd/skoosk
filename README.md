# skoosk

some kind of ortholinear split keyboard

The skoosk was my first attempt at creating a split ortholinear keyboard from scratch. The first production run had some issues with the pcb and the plate files. In the process of rectifying these issues I ended up creating simplifying the pcb for manual assembly. There are two different types of switch and backplates. One for more bounce, the other for more stability.

## Project Files

*skoosk pcb rgb* is not designed for manual assembly supporting LEDs and a reset switch if wanted.

*skoosk switchplate & backplate 4 screwholes* each have 4 outer screwholes that give the sandwhich assembly a good amount of bounce.

*skoosk switchplate & backplate 8 screwholes* have 8 screwholes in total to offer more stability for the whole sandwhich case.

## Todo
- [ ] test newest pcb revision
- [ ] add firmware support for the RGB indicator leds
