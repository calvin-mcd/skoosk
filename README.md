# skoosk

some kind of ortholinear split keyboard

The skoosk was my first attempt at creating a split ortholinear keyboard from scratch. The first production run had some issues with the pcb and the plate files. In the process of rectifying these issues I ended up creating two different PCB version, and two different types of switch and backplates.

*skoosk pcb* contains smt assembly parts. 1 reset button and 3 rgb lights with resistors.

*skoosk pcb no rgb* omits these to offer a pcb file that is cheap to order and produce.

*skoosk switchplate & backplate 4 screwholes* each have 4 outer screwholes that give the sandwhich assembly a good amount of bounce.

*skoosk switchplate & backplate 8 screwholes* have 8 screwholes in total to offer more stability for the whole sandwhich case.

Please note that this project has *not* been tested in its final state and I am *not responsible* for any outcomes of its use. However, feel free to edit, modify and otherwise utilise these files.

As always big thanks to the many people who helped me with the pcb, firmware and much more!
